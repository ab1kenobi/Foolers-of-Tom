Temperature predictor uses a random forest regressor model trained on longitude, latitude,
year, month, day, and day of week. The data was sourced from
https://github.com/neetika6/Machine-Learning-Model-for-Weather-Forecasting/tree/main ,where
the content of the weather from kanpur.csv were parsed to include only historical data involving
temperature from 2014-2021. Since the data was divided in two csv file was first combined the
data into a singular data frame, afterwards we preprocessed the data in order to split the
columns within the data frame, convert the data types and handle any missing values. (Quick
note the temperature data type changed to Fahrenheit though a quick edit to other temperature
type would alter temp output) Features such as year, month, day, and day of week and target
which is temperature are selected and split into two sets of data for training and testing. The
model provides us Mean absolute error, Mean squared error, R-squared(Goodness of fit) to
determine the accuracy of the temperature predicted. Given user input for any location in the
United States and date the model will output a temperature with an average deviation being
2.29(MAE), the MSE also providing a difference value, and R-squared giving a metric indication
of the proportion of variance ranging from 0-1, (R-Squared = 0.921).

Initially the plan for the temperature predictor model was to give a range of hot, moderate and
cold temperatures for the user to make their judgement on, given these classification for the
predictions we opted to use a random forest classifier model to determine the classification of
the day's temperature via likelihood. However given the scope of temperature we were working
with we kept getting a moderate output for all days and locations. The only real reason we
wanted to classify the temperature was to output a below freezing string that would alter the
kind of precipitation that would fall i.e. either snow or rain. However, given that freezing
temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit that could easily be adjusted. So we switched over
to a regression model to provide a numeric prediction averaged from the models decisions.


The rainfall model used a random forest classification model. It was trained on longitude,
latitude, and months of the year. The model was trained on data pulled from earthaccess.
Specifically, the data was pulled from"M2SDNXSLV". In order to specifically get more data, we
looped over 10 latitudes and longitudes in a min max region. We set our bounding box to the
United States. The reason why this is important is because for certain regions such as the
tropics or very dry areas, it may not respond correctly. Below is the classifier feature importance.
It shows that while the model was trained on various different aspects, the domininating feature
that trained the model was the month with the next feature being the longitude of the area. The
model had achieved a 63 percent accuracy. In order to increase the accuracy, we could have
increased the bounding box, but the model did not load and at this current time, we had beliefs
that if the model did not load, then it would take too long to retrieve any data. The model has 2
main features: give a predictability score, classify the score as rainy or not rainy. Testing various
regions around the United States had yielded positive results as areas such as the deserts in
Arizona gave a low score of rain and a non rainy rating.
